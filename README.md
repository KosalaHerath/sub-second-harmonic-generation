# Non-equilibrium Transitions in Sub/Second Harmonic Generation : Quantum Picture

This study presents a quantum statistical analysis of a non-linear optical system with a mode coupled to its second harmonic.  Quantum fluctuations are included via a Fokker-Planck equation for a generalized P representation .
